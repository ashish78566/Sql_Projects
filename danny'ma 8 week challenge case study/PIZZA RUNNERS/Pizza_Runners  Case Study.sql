-- customers to rate their runner. Design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a

 #step 1: Add Indexes
 alter table runner_orders add index (order_id);
 alter table runners add index (runner_id);

#step 2:create the 'runner_ratings table with foreign keys'
create table runner_ratings(
rating_id int auto_increment primary key,
order_id int,
runner_id int,
rating int,
foreign key(order_id) references runner_orders(order_id),
foreign key(runner_id) references runners(runner_id)
);

#step 3: insert sample data into the 'runner_ratings' Table 
insert into runner_ratings(order_id,runner_id,rating) values
(1,1,5),
(2,1,4),
(3,1,5),
(4,2,3),
(5,3,4),
(7,2,5),
(8,2,4),
